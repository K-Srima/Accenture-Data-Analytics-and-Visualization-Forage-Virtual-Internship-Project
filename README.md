# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

Now that you understand the project and your role, it's time to start working. Even if you're new to data analysis, we'll guide you step by step.

The client has provided:

- 7 datasets with various columns and values
- A data model showing relationships between datasets and links for merging tables

To avoid getting overwhelmed, follow these steps:

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modeling

Start by identifying which datasets are needed to determine the top 5 categories by popularity. Once you’ve selected the right datasets, complete the quiz to proceed.

# Data Cleaning:

# To clean the data:

- Remove rows with missing values.
- Adjust the data type for certain values within specific columns.
- Eliminate columns that are not relevant to the task.

Consider the relevance of each column to the business question. If a column doesn’t seem useful, it may be unnecessary to include.

# The final result will be three cleaned datasets:
1. Content_csv.csv
2. Reaction Types.csv
3. Reactions.csv

# Data Modelling
Create a final data set by merging the above 3 tables

End Result will be One Spreadsheet
1. A Cleaned Dataset
2. Top 5 Categories

# Cleaned Data Set
So, the dataset after Data Cleaning and Data Modelling : [FINAL DATA.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16828745/FINAL.DATA.xlsx)
